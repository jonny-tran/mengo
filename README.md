# Mengo - AI Virtual Mentor

**Vision: Pedagogy-First**

Mengo is a B2B2C EdTech SaaS tool built to solve one of the biggest challenges for programming students: the "Cold Start Problem."

## The Core Problem (The Pain Point)

Programming students, especially in teams, often experience "Cognitive Paralysis" when given a vague project brief.

They don't know where to start or how to decompose the work (break down tasks). This leads to chaotic teamwork ("tao-work"), where tasks are unstructured, members block each other, and the project fails.

Current project management tools (like Trello or Notion) are just "passive blank pages." They provide a place to manage tasks, but they don't solve the core pain of how to create those tasks in the first place.

## The Solution

Mengo is an "AI-Kanban" designed specifically for education.

Instead of starting with a blank slate, Mengo's core flow is:

1. **Paste the Brief**: A student copies and pastes their project brief into Mengo.
2. **AI Analysis**: Mengo's AI instantly analyzes the brief.
3. **Generate Plan**: Mengo automatically generates a detailed, structured project plan on a Kanban board, complete with Epics, Tasks, and Sub-tasks/Checklists.

## The Defensible Moat

Mengo's goal is not "to do the work," but "to teach."

Our core advantage is the "Virtual Mentor" feature (the 💡 "Hint" button). Every AI-generated task comes with a 3-level pedagogical hint system:

- **Metacognitive**: Teaches the student how to think about the problem ("What questions should you be asking yourself right now?").
- **Conceptual**: Guides the student on the concepts needed ("It looks like you need to understand 'REST APIs' or 'State Management' for this task.").
- **Keywords**: Provides specific terms to search for ("Try searching for 'React Context API' or 'NestJS DTO'").

## Business Model

We are pursuing a B2B2C (Product-Led Growth) model.

- **B2C (Free)**: Provided to students. Our primary GTM channel is Hackathons.
- **B2B (Paid)**: Selling an "Instructor Dashboard" to Coding Bootcamps (Priority 1) and University CS departments (Priority 2).
